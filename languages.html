    <h3 id="python">Python</h3>
		<p> > Python is a great language to start learning as its syntax is very similar to English. </p>
		<p> > Used in data analysis, artificial intelligence, and backend web development, Python is used in many professional companies. </p>
		<p> > With the availability of a large range of libraries, Python allows for a wide range of projects. </p>
		<hr>
		<h3 id="html">HTML/CSS</h3>
		<p> > HTML and CSS can be thought of as an inseperable pair. One is always dependent on the other when it comes to web development. </p>
		<p> > HTML can be thought of as the structure and content of a website, while CSS provides all of the stylistic elements. </p>
		<p> > Although these languages may seem simple to learn, it still takes a lot of skill to create professional and flawless websites.</p>
		<hr>
		<h3 id="java">Java</h3>
		<p> > Java is an high-level, object-oriented programming language used to create many web applications. </p>
		<p> > The language is very flexible, relatively easy to learn, and used in many large-scale applications. </p>
		<p> > However, the language is slowly becoming outdated and used <i>slightly</i> less in today's industry. </p>
		<hr>
		<h3 id="cpp">C++</h3>
		<p> > As in the name, C++ is a hybrid language that combines the capabilities of C (a procedural programming language) and object-oriented programming. </p>
		<p> > C++ gives you the ability to control the use of your computer's resources and maximize performance. </p>
		<p> > However, this language can be difficult to learn at first as the syntax can seem unintuative and requires a lot of precision. </p>
		<hr>
		<h3 id="js">JavaScript</h3>
		<p> > JavaScript is used for web development and other user-interactive applications. </p>
		<p> > Although HTML/CSS may act as the foundation, JavaScript makes a website truly functional and interactive. </p>
		<p> > Nowadays, it has been used for mobile/desktop apps as well as game development. </p>
